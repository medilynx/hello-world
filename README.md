# hello-world
My first attempts at coding
Hey guys, prior to this, I've had some beginner courses in C++, Matlab, and Visual Basics. 
I'm not sure how this little exploration would turn out to be, but I hope that I would be able to pick up some useful skills that I can apply to either my work, or perhaps start a new hobby out of this.
